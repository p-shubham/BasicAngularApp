# BasicAngularApp
The WebApp works on AngularJs. This is the first project in series to learn the essentials of AngularJs. Services tab works properly fetches data from services.json. Other tabs will show just their Titles and not content because none have been put their since, other procedures are similar to services.

What did I learn?

1. Basics of AngularJS
2. Contollers
3. $scope
4. $http
5. angular-routing
6. ng-view
7. fetching data from JSON file.

Thanks!
